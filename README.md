# GOMA 
`Side project for the coming months`
## Outline
To provide an easy to use, cost affective database for GOMA art gallery. GOMA is a non profit run Art Gallery in Waterford city, a working database would help with day to day tasks of running the gallery, its volunteers, artists, events etc.

Proof of concept of this database will be done using Amazons Relational Database Services. The database will be connected to an apache server on EC2. Once the database is fit for purpose, I will begin implementing the database and server using a raspberry pie or pine64, in order to make the DB as cost affective as possible with a limited amount of IT resources. 

### Updates

Updates to this project will be added to the repo and documented in this README. 

Updates will be some what slow as this is a side project over the coming months.
